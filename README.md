# Task 04 - Basic Firewall Management

## âœ… Objective
To create, apply, test, and understand basic Windows Firewall rules.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did
- Created a rule to block port 23 (Telnet).
- Tested connection â€” it was blocked.
- (Optional) Created a rule to allow port 22 (SSH).
- Learned how firewalls filter network traffic based on rules.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
See the screenshots in this folder showing:
- Firewall rules created
- Test result of blocked Telnet port

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
- Firewalls control which ports are open or closed
- Port 23 is unsafe and often blocked (Telnet is outdated)
- Port 22 is used for secure SSH connections
